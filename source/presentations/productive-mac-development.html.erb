# Productive Mac Development

Brian Kelly

---

# Prerequisites

- You're on a Mac
- You have administrative rights on your machine
- You have an App Store account

---

# Upgrade to the latest macOS

- You can get [macOS Sierra from the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/macos-sierra/id1127487414?mt=12) for free

---

# Install the latest XCode

- You can get [XCode from the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835) for free
- Many development tools rely on having XCode installed

---

# Start Apps Quickly

- Hold down the Command key (⌘) and press the space bar
- The `Spotlight Search` window pops up
- Type the name of application you want to start, for example `Terminal`
- Press enter
- This is much faster than using the Dock or Finder

---

# Switch Apps Quickly

- Hold down the Command key (⌘) and tap the Tab key repeatedly
- This will take you through your open Apps
- When you let go of the Command key you'll switch to the selected app
- You can hold down Shift to go backwards

---

# Quit Apps Quickly

- Switch back to Terminal
- Hold down the Command key (⌘) and press `Q`

---

# Agree to the XCode License

- Start Terinal using Spotlight (Slide 5)
- In the Terminal window that pops up, type the following:
  - `sudo xcodebuild -license`
- It will ask for your password (the one you log into your computer with)
- Press `q` to jump to the end of the license
- Type `agree` and press return to agree to the license

---

# What is sudo?

- `sudo` lets you run commands as another user.
- By default that user is `root`, which has access too all commands and files on the system.
- You should have to use `sudo` very infrequently.

---

# Use Homebrew

[Homebrew](http://brew.sh) is a Package Manager. You use Homebrew to install, update and manage Packages.

Packages can be:

- **Applications** such as Spotify, Sublime Text or Slack
- **Services** such as MySQL, Apache or Elasticsearch
- **Languages** such as Ruby, Python or Node
- **Command-Line Tools** such as ImageMagick, Maven or Grunt

While you are developing software you will likely need to install a number of these packages.

---

# Install Homebrew

- Start Terminal using Spotlight
- Copy and paste the following into your Terminal window:

```bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

---

# Keep Homebrew Happy

Run the following commands semi-regularly:

- `brew update` to keep Homebrew up to date.
- `brew doctor` to keep Homebrew healthy.
  - This may give you some information to act on, which you should.
- `brew cleanup` to keep Homebrew slim by uninstalling old versions of packages.

---

# Use iTerm2

[iTerm 2](https://www.iterm2.com/) is an arguably better version of Terminal.

- In your Terminal window type `brew cask install iterm2`
- Then use Spotlight to start iTerm 2
- Switch to Terminal and quit it

---

# What is a cask?

TK

---

# Install ShiftIt

[ShiftIt](https://github.com/fikovnik/ShiftIt) is a tool that lets you easily manage your appliation's windows using the keyboard instead of the mouse.

You can install it using Homebrew:

```sh
brew cask install shiftit
```

Then use Spotlight to start ShiftIt. It will likely inform you that it needs some permissions to control your machine.

---

# Giving ShiftIt Permissions

ShiftIt needs permission to control your computer. Let's give it that permission.

1. Use Spotlight to open your `Security & Privacy` preferences.
1. Select the `Privacy` tab.
1. In the left sidebar choose `Accessibility`.
1. Click the lock in the lower left corner to make changes and enter your password.
1. In the right-hand pane titled `Allow the apps below to control your computer.` check the box next to `ShiftIt`
1. Quit your `Security & Privacy` preferences.
1. Start ShiftIt again using Spotlight.

---

# Use ShiftIt

By default you can use ShiftIt by holding down Control, Option and Command at the same time and then pressing:

- Left arrow to move the current window the left half of your screen.
- Right arrow to move the current window the right half of your screen.
- `M` to maximize the current window.
- `C` to center the current window.
- `F` to full screen the current application.

# Learn & Use Git

[Git](https://git-scm.com) is arguably the preferred [Version Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) system used by developers today.

Teaching Git is outside the scope of this presentation but I suggest the following free Git courses:

- [Try Git](https://try.github.io/)
- [Learn Git](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git)
- [Learn Git with Bitbucket Cloud](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/learn-git-with-bitbucket-cloud)

# Install Git

Git is provided by OS X/macOS these days but lets make sure we have the latest version installed using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install git
```

Once it's done check the version of Git installed:

```bash
$ git --version
git version 2.11.0
```

---

# Why no cask this time?

---

## Bash Shell

---

# Stop typing commands over and over

## Use shell command history

---

# Stop typing commands over and over

## Use shell command search

---

# Install bash-it

---

# Use Homebrew to Install Stuff

---

# Use Version Managers for Programming Languages

---

# Use Dependency Management Tools

---

# Take Notes

---

# Use Shortcut Keys

---

# Use Time Boxing

---

# Use Google Chrome Profiles
